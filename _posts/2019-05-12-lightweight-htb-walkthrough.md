This post documents the complete walkthrough of Lightweight, a retired vulnerable [VM][1] created by [0xEA31][2], and hosted at [Hack The Box][3]. If you are uncomfortable with spoilers, please stop reading now.

### Background

Lightweight is a retired vulnerable VM from Hack The Box.

### Information Gathering

Letâ€™s start with a `nmap` scan to establish the available services in the host.

```
# nmap -n -v -Pn -p- -A --reason -oN nmap.txt 10.10.10.119
...
PORT    STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION
22/tcp  open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 63 OpenSSH 7.4 (protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey:

|_ssl-date: TLS randomness does not represent time
```

`nmap` finds `22/tcp`, `80/tcp` and surprise, surprise, `389/tcp` open. At this point in time, my best bet is to start with the `http` service. This is how it looks like.

### Low-Privilege Shell

Instead of going straight for directories/files enumeration, it pays to explore the site in greater details by carefully reading the instructions.

<a class="image-popup">
![8b104113.png](/assets/images/posts/lightweight-htb-walkthrough/8b104113.png)
</a>

If you play your cards correctly, you'll use `10.10.14.2` to login instead.

Let's do that.

### Privilege Escalation

During enumeration of `10.10.14.2`'s account, I used `ldapsearch` to enumerate the LDAP database.

```
[10.10.14.2@lightweight ~]$ ldapsearch -H ldap:// -x -b 'dc=lightweight,dc=htb'
# extended LDIF
#
# LDAPv3
# base <dc=lightweight,dc=htb> with scope subtree

You can see that the `crypt`-hashed, `base64`-encoded passwords of `ldapuser1` and `ldapuser2` are exposed. The passwords are close to unbreakable because of the salt and six iteration rounds. Obviously, cracking the hash is not the way to go.

How do we get the passwords then? LDAPv3 uses various authentication methods and simple authentication is where plaintext username and password are sent over the wire, susceptible to network sniffing.

<a class="image-popup">
![3cc96c70.png](/assets/images/posts/lightweight-htb-walkthrough/3cc96c70.png)
</a>

You can see that `tcpdump` has the capabilities to basically capture all network traffic even in a low-privileged account, such as the one I'm using.

How do we trigger the authentication then? By going to `status.php` because it took time to load. Something must be going on behind the scenes.

<a class="image-popup">
![a32107ca.png](/assets/images/posts/lightweight-htb-walkthrough/a32107ca.png)
</a>

Once the page is loaded, a LDAP request is sent from the page to the LDAP server with the username and password sent in plaintext.

<a class="image-popup">
![e4f1a700.png](/assets/images/posts/lightweight-htb-walkthrough/e4f1a700.png)
</a>

We should be able to log in to `ldapuser2`'s account.

<a class="image-popup">
![6f8aeec9.png](/assets/images/posts/lightweight-htb-walkthrough/6f8aeec9.png)
</a>

Bingo.

`user.txt` is at `ldapuser2`'s home directory.

<a class="image-popup">
![911fe765.png](/assets/images/posts/lightweight-htb-walkthrough/911fe765.png)
</a>

In the same location, there's a password-protected 7z archive as well.

<a class="image-popup">
![9d40ceba.png](/assets/images/posts/lightweight-htb-walkthrough/9d40ceba.png)
</a>

I copy the file over to my attacking machine for offline cracking using `base64` like so.

```
[ldapuser2@lightweight ~]$ base64 -w0 backup.7z && echo
```

Copy and paste the `base64` string over to my attacking machine and `base64` decode it back to the file.

```
# echo -n N3q8rycc...BPiBwEwAA | base64 -d > backup.7z
```

Use `7z2john` to generate a hash and send it to John the Ripper for cracking.

<a class="image-popup">
![7bb83fa4.png](/assets/images/posts/lightweight-htb-walkthrough/7bb83fa4.png)
</a>

It's the backup of the PHP files used in the site. In `status.php`, you'll find the password of `ldapuser1`.

<a class="image-popup">
![e6457731.png](/assets/images/posts/lightweight-htb-walkthrough/e6457731.png)
</a>

Awesome.

<a class="image-popup">
![c743f039.png](/assets/images/posts/lightweight-htb-walkthrough/c743f039.png)
</a>

The `openssl` here has super powers! It can basically do anything.

<a class="image-popup">
![494f80c4.png](/assets/images/posts/lightweight-htb-walkthrough/494f80c4.png)
</a>

With that in mind, let's encrypt/decrypt `/etc/sudoers` to `/tmp`, include `ldapuser1` to `sudo` list with some `sed` magic, and then encrypt/decrypt it back to `/etc/sudoers`.

<a class="image-popup">
![3d242375.png](/assets/images/posts/lightweight-htb-walkthrough/3d242375.png)
</a>

Awesome. We can now `sudo` ourselves as `root` and retrieve `root.txt`.
