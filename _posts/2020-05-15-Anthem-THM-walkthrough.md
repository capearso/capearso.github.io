## Background

Anthem is a weekly challange vulnerable VM from Try Hack Me.

## Information Gathering

Letâ€™s start with a `nmap` scan to establish the open ports in the host.

```
# nmap -vv --reason -Pn -sV -sC --version-all -oN /root/Desktop/THM/Anthem/scans/tcp_nmap.txt
...
Increasing send delay for 10.10.63.195 from 0 to 5 due to 169 out of 563 dropped probes since last increase.
Nmap scan report for 10.10.63.195

### Flag One and Website Analysis

Appears to be some kind of `http` service. Here's how it looks like.

{% include image.html image_alt="anthem_ehocop.jpg" image_src="anthem_ehocop.jpg" %}

First things first we go to http://10.10.63.195/robots.txt

{% include image.html image_alt="anthemrobots_vemv4o.png" image_src="anthemrobots_vemv4o.png" %}

It looks we found a password or something that should not be in robots.txt at the top. We add this to a list of passwords for later use. We also find out that this system is running a Umbraco CMS.

{% include image.html image_alt="poem_bq2pmn.png" image_src="poem_bq2pmn.png" %}

Looking through the posts we find a poem that was about the Admin of the site. We google that poem and find out it was written by Solomon Grundy. We add them to users on the site to try later. 
In the HR post we see the email format is FL@anthem.com where F is first name and L is last name. So we create the user SG@anthem.com.

{% include image.html image_alt="flag1_a7okeq.png" image_src="flag1_a7okeq.png" %}

Looking at the source code of the hiring page we can find our first flag in <meta content>

### Flag Two

{% include image.html image_alt="flag2_wjcmbn.png" image_src="flag2_wjcmbn.png" %}

We go back to the main page and view the source of website. This leads us to flag number two which can be found in the source code.

### Flag Three

{% include image.html image_alt="flag3_h41kft.png" image_src="flag3_h41kft.png" %}

We click on the we are hiring page and see that Jane Doe is the author and we can navigate to a page called /authors/jane-doe. We follow the link and are awarded are third flag.

### Flag Four

{% include image.html image_alt="flag4_aznzrp.png" image_src="flag4_aznzrp.png" %}

By following the steps for Flag One we can find Flag Four in the meta content on the IT poem page.

### Low-Privilege Shell

{% include image.html image_alt="umbraco_jwou73.png" image_src="umbraco_jwou73.png" %}

Armed with this knowledge, we go to 10.10.63.195/umbraco and try logging in as SG@anthem.com and using the password we found on the robots.txt We are able to log in. 
We can determine the Umbraco version by clining the ? icon and see that we are attacking Umbraco 7.15.4


Bingo.

### Getting `user.txt`

There's another user `robert` (uid=1000). I suppose the file `user.txt` is in his home directory.

{% include image.html image_alt="ffe06c72.png" image_src="/471fc23c-9a1d-4b65-974a-92b516907d9f/ffe06c72.png" %}

In `check.txt`, we have our clue how to get `robert`'s password.

```
Encrypting this file with your key should result in out.txt, make sure your key is correct!
```

I suppose when we encrypt `check.txt` with a key (yet to be determined) using `SuperSecureCrypt.py`, we'll get `out.txt`. Here are the relevant `encrypt` and `decrypt` functions `SuperSecureCrypt.py`.

```python
def encrypt(text, key):
    keylen = len(key)
    keyPos = 0
    encrypted = ""
    for x in text:
        keyChr = key[keyPos]
        newChr = ord(x)
        newChr = chr((newChr + ord(keyChr)) % 255)
        encrypted += newChr
        keyPos += 1
        keyPos = keyPos % keylen
    return encrypted

def decrypt(text, key):
    keylen = len(key)
    keyPos = 0
    decrypted = ""
    for x in text:
        keyChr = key[keyPos]
        newChr = ord(x)
        newChr = chr((newChr - ord(keyChr)) % 255)
        decrypted += newChr
        keyPos += 1
        keyPos = keyPos % keylen
    return decrypted
```

It shouldn't be too hard to write a Python script to recover the key based on the "secure" algorithm above. :wink:

<div class="filename"><span>recover.py</span></div>

```python
import sys

key = ''

chk = open(sys.argv[1], 'rb').read().decode('utf-8')
out = open(sys.argv[2], 'rb').read().decode('utf-8')

keylen = int(sys.argv[3])
if (keylen > len(chk) or keylen > len(out)):
    raise ValueError("Key is longer than plaintext or ciphertext")

for x in range(keylen):
    for c in range(256):
        if ((ord(chk[x]) + c) % 255 == ord(out[x])):
            key += chr(c)
            break

print "[*] Key is: %s" % key
```

Simply increase the key size until the key repeats itself.

{% include image.html image_alt="cdf54e7d.png" image_src="/471fc23c-9a1d-4b65-974a-92b516907d9f/cdf54e7d.png" %}

The key is `alexandrovichalexandrovich`. :triumph:

Armed with the key, we can utilize `SuperSecureCrypt.py` to get `robert`'s password.

{% include image.html image_alt="baac1320.png" image_src="/471fc23c-9a1d-4b65-974a-92b516907d9f/baac1320.png" %}

The password is `SecThruObsFTW`. Let's log in to `robert`'s account and grab that `user.txt`!

{% include image.html image_alt="1fa5dc36.png" image_src="/471fc23c-9a1d-4b65-974a-92b516907d9f/1fa5dc36.png" %}

## Privilege Escalation

During enumeration of `robert`'s account, I notice that `robert` is able to `sudo BetterSSH.py` as `root` without password.

{% include image.html image_alt="6d0ae26e.png" image_src="/471fc23c-9a1d-4b65-974a-92b516907d9f/6d0ae26e.png" %}

That must be the ticket to `root`! Again, I'm showing the pertinent part where the code is vulnerable.

{% include image.html image_alt="427719f0.png" image_src="/471fc23c-9a1d-4b65-974a-92b516907d9f/427719f0.png" %}

It's kinda like a race condition. As long as I'm able to display the contents of whatever that's written to `/tmp/SSH/<random eight chars>`, I'll be able to capture the encrypted password of `root` in `/etc/shadow`. Towards that end, I wrote a simple shell script to monitor for the creation of new file in `/tmp/SSH` and `cat` its content.

<div class="filename"><span>watch.sh</span></div>

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ ! -d /tmp/SSH ]; then
  mkdir -p /tmp/SSH
fi

touch /tmp/SSH/ok

while :; do
  find /tmp/SSH -type f -cnewer /tmp/SSH/ok -exec cat {} \;
done
```

I have two terminal windows. On one hand, I had the script watching for new files in `/tmp/SSH`. On the other hand, I just need to `sudo BetterSSH.py`.

{% include image.html image_alt="c115ee36.png" image_src="/471fc23c-9a1d-4b65-974a-92b516907d9f/c115ee36.png" %}

Woohoo!

### Getting `root.txt`

Now, it's a matter of firing up John the Ripper to crack the password.

{% include image.html image_alt="6ca9732a.png" image_src="/471fc23c-9a1d-4b65-974a-92b516907d9f/6ca9732a.png" %}

Armed with `root`'s password, getting `root.txt` should be a breeze.

{% include image.html image_alt="f003f2f9.png" image_src="/471fc23c-9a1d-4b65-974a-92b516907d9f/f003f2f9.png" %}
