## Background

It's originally created for HackTheBox.

## Information Gathering

Letâ€™s start with a `nmap` scan to establish the available services in the host.

```
# nmap -n -v -Pn -p- -A --reason -oN nmap.txt 192.168.20.130
...
PORT     STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 64 OpenSSH 7.4p1 Debian 10+deb9u1 (protocol 2.0)

`nmap` finds a couple of open ports. JAMES 2.3.2 sure brings back memories. :wink:

## JAMES Remote Administration Tool 2.3.2

Heck. This is **screwed up**.

Let's list down the users with `listusers`.

<a class="image-popup">
![8cd5a986.png](/assets/images/posts/solidstate-1-walkthrough/8cd5a986.png)
</a>

I have an evil idea. Let's change all the users' password to their usernames.

</a>

## Reading Other's Emails

Now that I have changed all the passwords, I can log in to their POP3 account to read their emails.

</a>

You can see that James asked John to send Mindy a temporary password for SSH access.

<a class="image-popup">
![756a4ea3.png](/assets/images/posts/solidstate-1-walkthrough/756a4ea3.png)
</a>

Let's see if the password is valid.

## Low-Privilege Shell

<a class="image-popup">

</a>

The password works but we have a small problem.

## Bypass Restricted Shell

This is almost trivial to bypass. We know SSH allows us to execute commands upon login. With this in mind, we can do something like this.

## Privilege Escalation

During enumeration of `mindy`'s account, I found a world-writable file `/opt/tmp.py`. Here's how it looks like.

<a class="image-popup">

</a>

If I had to guess, I would say this is run by `crontab` under `root`'s account. Let's replace it with something special. :smiling_imp:

<a class="image-popup">
![cb88cc77.png](/assets/images/posts/solidstate-1-walkthrough/cb88cc77.png)
</a>

About three minutes later, a `root` shell appears.

:dancer:

## Afterthought

Here's the user's flag for completeness sake.
