# Introduction

Potion is a customized Jekyll theme partially derived from the work of others,
namely:

* [Leonids](https://github.com/renyuanz/leonids) by Renyuan Zou
* [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) by Mark Otto
* [So Simple](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme) by Micheal Rose

The theme represents a concoction of the parts I like about from the other
themes, hence the name Potion. Don't you think it's awesome when
the footer the site says "Powered by Jekyll and Potion"?

_Did you know that Dr. Jekyll originally developed the
potion to suppress Mr. Hyde from appearing, not the other way round?_

I started with Leonids and loved the sidebar. The sidebar was clean,
simple and tastefully designed. When I decided to include a more responsive
layout, Hyde came to mind and I adopted it. And when I decided to add
pagination to manage the blog posts I wrote, the pagination from So Simple
inspired me so much, I ended up including that into the mix as well.

All mistakes are mine alone.
