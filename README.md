This customized theme is derived partially from the work of others, namely:

* [Leonids](https://github.com/renyuanz/leonids) by Renyuan Zou
* [So Simple](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme) by Micheal Rose
* [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) by Mark Otto

I shall call it Potion since it's a concoction of other themes. 
You know, the site is powered by Jekyll and Potion :wink:

I first started with Leonids. I loved the sidebar. It was tastefully designed.
However, as I moved along I needed a clean and simple layout. Hyde came to mind
and so I adopted it. And when I added pagination, I was so inspired by the  
navigation from So Simple and I included that into the mix as well.

All mistakes are mine and mine alone.
